# CodePal

CodePal is a command line tool with a chat interface that helps developers write code. It is built on top of GPT-3 and ChatGPT (which is a work in progress), and provides a convenient and intuitive way for developers to write code quickly and efficiently.

## Features

- Chat-based interface that allows for natural, conversational code writing
- Built on top of GPT-3 and ChatGPT (soon), providing state-of-the-art natural language processing capabilities
- Easy to use and customize to your personal coding style

## Installation

To install CodePal, simply run the following command:

```sh
npm install codepal
```

To install it globally use:

```sh
npm install -g codepal
```

## Usage

Before using CodePal, you will need to set up an environment variable with your OpenAI credentials. This can be done by adding the following line to a `.env` file in your project directory:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

Once you've set up the environment variable, you can use CodePal by navigating to the directory where you want to write your code and running the following command:

```sh
npx codepal
```

This will start the CodePal chat interface, where you can write your code using natural language. CodePal will save your chat history in a directory called `.codepal` in your current working folder. To continue a previous chat session, you can provide the path to the chat history file, like this:

```sh
npx codepal .codepal/b1a7e548-da06-48be-9844-50f9b9c9436b.md
```

Alternatively, you can just provide the filename (without the path), like this:

```sh
npx codepal b1a7e548-da06-48be-9844-50f9b9c9436b
```

In this case, CodePal will automatically look for the chat history file in the `.codepal` directory of your current working folder.

The command line tool will also be made aware of git in the coming weeks/days, allowing for even more convenient code writing.

## Examples

Examples of using CodePal can be found in the `.codepal` directory of your project. These examples show different ways to use CodePal to write code, and can serve as a useful reference for getting started with the tool.

## License

CodePal is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

[User]

I need to extend the readme file to mention that codepal can be executed directly via npx.

[Assistent]

Sure, I can help you with that. To execute CodePal directly via npx, you can use the following command:

```sh
npx codepal
```

This will start the CodePal chat interface, where you can write your code using natural language. To continue a previous chat session, you can provide the path to the chat history file, like this:

```sh
npx codepal .codepal/b1a7e548-da06-48be-9844-50f9b9c9436b.md
```

Alternatively, you can just provide the filename (without the path), like this:

```sh
npx codepal b1a7e548-da06-48be-9844-50f9b9c9436b
```

In this case, CodePal will automatically look for the chat history file in the `.codepal` directory of your current working folder.

[User]

For interactive mode the user need to use the -i flag. And in order to resume a session the user needs to use the -s flag. There is also a flag to start with a pre-defined template. The flag is -t. Templates are effectively like pre-prompts that will be added at the beggining of the session. There is another flag `-f`, which is used to pre prompt with the contents of a file. Can you add these into the readme and describe what they do?

[Assistent]

Sure, I can add these flags to the README.md. The `-i` flag is used to start CodePal in interactive mode, which allows you to write code using natural language. The `-s` flag is used to resume a previous chat session, and the `-t` flag is used to start with a pre-defined template. The `-f` flag is used to pre prompt with the contents of a file.

Expand on those and add them to the usage section of the readme.
