# CodePal

CodePal is a command line tool with a chat interface that helps developers write code. It is built on top of GPT-3 and ChatGPT (which is a work in progress), and provides a convenient and intuitive way for developers to write code quickly and efficiently.

## Features

- Chat-based interface that allows for natural, conversational code writing
- Built on top of GPT-3 and ChatGPT, providing state-of-the-art natural language processing capabilities
- Easy to use and customize to your personal coding style

## Installation

To install CodePal, simply run the following command:

```sh
npm install codepal
```

## Usage

To use CodePal, navigate to the directory where you want to write your code and run the following command:
